# VPC fundamentals


## Availability Zones
AWS maps the physical Availability Zones randomly to the Availability Zone names for each AWS account. This approach helps to distribute resources across the Availability Zones in an AWS Region, instead of resources likely being concentrated in Availability Zone "a" for each Region


## VPC

Default VPC already configure with IGW (can be deleted/re-created)
Max size /16
Min size /28

AWS reserves 4 first address and the last one in the subnet.
When computing the number of hosts, don’t forget to subtract the 5 reserved addresses

If CIDR=/prefix => number of hosts = 2^(32-prefix)


CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
Default route always exist in VPC main route table 10.0.0.0/16 local => all subnets in the VPC can communicate
Best practice -> create a dedicated route for each subnet (easier to troubleshoot)
Dedicated subnet route table have precedence over main route table.

The more specific route always takes precedence.

Possible to extend VPC with secondary CIDR
- not overlapping and max number of routes in the VPC not reached
- with ranges from RFC1918
- Same or larger than the CIDR range of routes in any of the VPC RT
- 5 IPV4 CIDR block max / 1 IPV6 CIDR block max per VPC



## Subnets

Associated to one AZ
Can have custom route table
Public subnet = subnet with a route to internet
Private subnet = subnet with no route to internet (NAT GW / NAT instance to access internet)


## ENI
- Can not detach primary end from an instance
- Second ENI in the same AZ
- Can not be used for NIC teaming
- Number of secondary ENI IP addresses depends on EC2 instance type
- Dual-home ENI (in two different subnets)
- Cross-account ENI
    - In EKS, AWS managed control plane, ENI created in the customer VPC


## Bring Your Own Public IP
- To migrate your existing IPV4/IPV6 to AWS
- Keep IP reputation
- Avoid whitelisting changes
- AWS as hot standby only
- Create a Route Origin Authorization to advertise the IP from AWS
- Max 5 IPV4 and IPV5 per account


Private / Public IP

Private IP => do not change when instance restarts but released in pool when instance terminated
Auto-assigned public IP to EC2 => if instance Is restarted public IP is renewed -> changed (released in the AWS POOL)
EIP public IP=> if instance is restarted, EIP public IP is de-attached/re-attached -> not changed (not released in the AWS POOL, billed/stayed in the account)

IPV6

128 bits in 8 blocks
Addresses are public and globally unique
Persists on restart, released on termination

Fixed CIDR
- For VPC /56
- For Subnet /64
Amazon provided DNS hostnames are not supported

Not support for site-to-site VPN, customer gateways, VPC endpoints


Firewall

Cannot block source IP with SG
NACL (stateless)/Security Groupe(statefull)



VPC DNS and DHCP


DNS

VPC comes with:
- default DNS resolver (AmazonProvidedDNS) :resolves private and forward to public DNS servers
- Default DHCP Options Set with domain-name and name-servers (AmazonProvidedDNS)

Amazon DNS runs at VPC CIDR +2 addresses

VPC settings:
- enableDnsSupport: true by default
- enableDnsHostname: false by default -> to assign  dns hostname
- Enable both parameters above to true if using custom dns domain names in private hosted zones


DHCP Options set
- Cannot modify when created
- Can create new and associate to VPC to update it
- Can assign only 1 options set
- DHCP options set is not mandatory
- Once associated, instance will use the new DHCP Options Set, instance automatically refreshes after few hours better to do it manually.


Hybrid DNS

Route53 Resolver Endpoint
- Inbound = on-premise to AWS
- Outbound = AWS to on-premise


If I have :

app record in private hosted zone sub.toto.com
- Private hosted zone app.sub.toto.com

# dig app.sub.toto.com will return SOA record from private hosted zone app.sub.toto.com


To associate a VPC that you created with one AWS account with a private hosted zone that you created with a different account:
- Not available in console
- Use API or CLI


Private Hosted Zones

Private DNS resolution
Create > Associate to all the necessary VPC




VPC Network Performance and Optimization


Basics

Bandwith: maximum rate of transfer
Latency: delay between 2 points of the network
Jitter: Variation in inter-packets delays
Throughput:rate of successful data transfer)
Packets Per Second: how many packer per second device cpu can handle
MTU: 
- larger packet that can be sent (default 1500 bytes) - DF flag
- If router cannot fragment; ICMP- change MTU sent back
- Jumbo frames 9001 bytes MTU, enabled by default in VPC; should be using carefully for traffic leaving the VPC
- Jumbo frames supported by DX
- Using Jumbo frames in EC2 cluster placement groups for max throughput
- Support depending on instance types (at ENI level
- Tracepath to check path MTU


When PPS is bottleneck => increase MTU


Cluster Placement Groups
Group of EC2 physically closed (same rack) within single AZ (low latency 10 Gbps network)
Can help help improve performance inside VPC


EBS Optimized Instances
EBS =  Network drive
Dedicated network between EC2 and EBS for EBS I/O and other network traffic


Enhanced Networking (> 1 million packets per second)
HPC: High Performance Computing
Can Help improve performance for traffic going outside the VPC

SRV-IOV with PCI passthrough to get hypervisor out of the way (remove hypervisor overhead in packet processing)
- 1 physical card to present multiple vNICs
- PCI passthrough enable PCI devices to appear as they are directly attached to Guest OS

Enabled using intel ixgbevf driver (up to 10Gbps) or Elastic Network Adapter (up to 100Gbps)-> depends on the instance type AND AMIs

Additional optimization techniques (remove Kernel overhead in packet processing):
DPDK
- Set libraries and drivers for fast packer processing
- Lower latency thanks to kernel bypass
EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)
- Dedicated ENA with additional capabilities
- OS bypass


Network Bandwidth Limits

No limit for VPC/Internet Gateway/VPC peering
NAT GW 45Gbps -> scale using multiple NAT GW

Single flow = 5-tupe (src dst; proto, sport, dport)
Aggregated bandwidth relates to Multi-flow 

EC2 bandwidth limits:
- Instance type, size, enhanced networking support,…
- Within the region, can utilize full bandwidth of the instance
    - for a single flow (5 tuple) traffic limited to 5 Gbps and 10Gbps for instance in cluster placement groups
    - For multi-flow up to 100 Gbps between EC2
- To other regions, Internet, Direct Connect , 50% (if > 32 cpu) or 5 Gbps

EC2 Maximum bandwidth
 - with ENA aggregate bandwidth of 100Gbps in same region/vpc endpoint

VPN and DX Bandwidth
- 1.25 Gbps per Virtual Private Gateway
- DX port speed

Transit Gateway
- 1.25  Gbps per VPN tunnel and total 50 Gpbs














VPC Internet Gateway

Internet Gateway (IGW) allows instances with public IPs to access the internet.
An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

Setup: 
- Create IGW
- Associate to VPC
- Update Subnet RT (0.0.0.0/0 dev IGW)
- Update NACL
- Create Security Group and associate to EC2 Instance
- Create EIP (Public IP) and associate to EC2 instance 


Effectue VPC data plane encapsulation/decapsulation
When creating EIP on EC2, we create a static one-to-one NAT entry into the VPC IGW 


NAT Gateway

5Gbps with scale up to 100 Gbps
Use EIP
Create in a specific AZ
Pay per usage and bandwidth
No security group

NAT Gateway (NGW) allows instances with no public IPs to access the internet.
- Launch EC2 instance in private subnets
- Update SG in/outbound
- Launch NAT GW in public subnet
- Allocate EIP to NAT GW
- Update private subnet RT

To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone.
No cross AZ failover needed because if AZ goes down it doesn’t need NAT !


NAT instances

Must be in public subnet with public EIP
Check Security Groups
Disable source destination check at VPC level
Modify route tables
Use script to failover between instances


Site-to-Site VPN Connections
https://aws.amazon.com/fr/vpn/pricing/#AWS_Site-to-Site_VPN_and_Accelerated_Site-to-Site_VPN_Connection_Pricing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FOvH5y9c2U&ab_channel=CloudAcademy


Key concepts:
* VPN connection: A secure connection between your on-premises equipment and your VPCs.
* VPN tunnel: An encrypted link where data can pass from the customer network to or from AWS. Each VPN connection includes two VPN tunnels which you can simultaneously use for high availability.
* Customer gateway: An AWS resource which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device.
* Customer gateway device: A physical device or software application on your side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
* Target gateway: A generic term for the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
* Virtual private gateway: A virtual private gateway is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of your Site-to-Site VPN connection that can be attached to a single VPC.
* Transit gateway: A transit hub that can be used to interconnect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, and as a VPN endpoint for the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.


Each Site-to-Site VPN connection has two tunnels (for redundancy in different AZ), with each tunnel using a unique public IP address.


The customer gateway device is owned but the customer in its datacenter. AWS customer gateway provides information about the customer gateway device to be able to setup the routing.

Create a Customer Gateway specifying:
- BGP ASN of your customer gateway device.
- IP address for your customer gateway device's external interface (must be static and behind WAF)
- ACM Certificate

ACM Certificate is optional (by default pre-shared)

Create a Virtual Gateway specifying name and use by default AWS ASN (type ipsec.1 is the only one)

Attach VGW to VPC (only 1 VPC can be attached)

Open the VPC Route Table

 
AWS Cost:
$0.05 per VPN Connection Hour (in case of redundant VPN connections => x2) + Standard AWS Data Transfer Charges
 
Default Limits:
50 CGW per region
5 VPG per regions
50 VPN connections per regions
10 VPN connections per VPC
Note : only 1 VPC per VPG


To enable redundant VPN connections:
* Set up a second Site-to-Site VPN connection by using the same virtual private gateway and creating a new customer gateway. The customer gateway IP address for the second Site-to-Site VPN connection must be publicly accessible.
* Configure a second customer gateway device. Both devices should advertise the same IP ranges to the virtual private gateway. We use BGP routing to determine the path for traffic. If one customer gateway device fails, the virtual private gateway directs all traffic to the working customer gateway device.
* Enable route propagation in the route table



Allow AWS to On-Prem DC VPN connection.

For Hybrid Architecture, AWS provides:
- VPC Site-to-site Transit GW
- VPN for multi-VPC connection with Transit GW
- AWS Direct Connect


Transit Gateway

Distributed, AWS region specific to inter-connect VPC,…

Up to 5 TGW per account (adjustable) and 5 TGW per VPC and 5000 attachements.

- Create TGW
- Create VPC attachement (check TGW RT -> state : associated -> enabled)
    - When you create a attachement you must specify subnet for each AZ to be used
- Update Subnet RT (route to TGW)

TGW attachement types:
- VPC
- Peering
- VPN
- DX


VPC Peering

IP connection between VPC CIDR (cross region and cross account)

- Create Peering Connection
- Accept Request
- Update Subnet RT
- 
VPC peering is the same AZ is free

Private Hosted Zones can be associated to VPC (cross account)



Private Link

Cross Account
Need VPC peering to do cross regions private link Unidirectional at TCP level (no IP overlap, connection always initiated from consumer)


Service Provider:
 - Create NLB/TargetGroup/Probe in VPC 
 - Create Service Endpoint (in ELB>Integrated Services)and associate to ELB 


NLB target group only supports: instances/ip addresses/lambda/ALB


Service Consumer 
- VPC can be any VPC under any account
Create VPC Endpoint (multiple ENI will be automatically created in different AZ)  and request association to Endpoint Service (must be accepted by provider).The DNS records created with a VPC endpoint are not private.


Add Private DNS on provider side in the endpoint service configuration (for example: *.eu.cloud.talend.com). Domain verification is done via TXT record (record to be added in public hosted zone)
Then enable private DNS also on consumer side once domain validation completed.

With Private DNS available, all the dns requests to the defined domain (for example: *.eu.cloud.talend.com)(dns request must publically resolvable) will be resolved to the IP address of the consumer endpoint ENI on the consumer side. 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-aws-services.html

To validate fro VM consumer request service using Consumer ENI.
